    <h1>OddsGame - User Guide</h1>

    <h2>Logging In</h2>
    <p>OddsGame requires either a Google or Facebook account to operate, this is in order to maintain
    a unique reference for you so that your games can be tracked whilst avoiding having to deal with
    remembering passwords and usernames. The added benefit of this is that both services make a
    profile image available - meaning you can easily identify your friends.</p>

    <h2>Creating an Odds Game</h2>
    <p>Once logged in, or when opening the app thereafter, you're presented with the default screen -
    the 'New Game' screen. To create a game you need to choose an opponent, select how high the odds
    should be, and say what the odds are for. When you're ready to play, click start game!</p>

    <h2>Playing an Odds Game</h2>
    <p>You can join an Odds Game in one of three ways:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Starting a new game</li>
        <li>Joining a game from a notification</li>
        <li>Joining a game from the Game Requests page</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Once in the game, both you and your opponent have to pick a number between 1 and the maximum
    odds specified when creating the game. When both players have 'locked in' their odds, there is
    a brief pause before the results are revealed to the players. In the case that the odds match,
    the player who created the game wins. If there isn't a match, then there is the option to reverse
    the odds and play again; in this instance, if there is a match then the player who didn't create
    the game wins. If there is still no match, then the game ends with no winners.</p>

    <h2>Viewing Odds Requests</h2>
    <p>You can view existing Odds Games by selecting 'Requests' in the menu drawer, this will show
    you any games where you are yet to lock in your odds. If you then click on a game it will open
    it where you can lock in your odds.</p>
